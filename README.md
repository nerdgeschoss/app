# Nerdgeschoss App

## Development

Things you may want to cover:
Make sure the nerdgeschoss development is running correctly (https://github.com/nerdgeschoss/development-environment) and follow the usual setup steps outlined there.

## Notifications to Slack:

To test notifications join the `test-channel` on the NG workspace in slack. That is where messages arrive in development.
To test notifications to private channels (e.g. HR channel ), create a new private channel, add the Nerdgeschoss App to the channel as an integration and insert the channel ID into the credentials.
